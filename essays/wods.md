Here are my thoughts of the day (T.O.D.s) about workouts of the day (W.O.D.s)

W.O.D.s are how programmers “work out.” They are short coding challenges which must be completed as quickly as possible. The quicker the time, the more proficient of a programmer you are deemed. This is a new concept to me, as before this point, I have coded under relatively little pressure (well, disregarding deadlines and tests), and I have never highly regarded my programming speed as something that is extremely important. However, after some experience, I now realize that speed can play a huge factor when programming. Tiny redundant tasks can suck up a lot of time. If you know the shortcuts, you can become a programmer who works smarter, not harder.

### W.O.D. #1

The details of the first W.O.D. that I attempted can be found here.  These particular W.O.D.s have some software requirements, such as the use of GitHub and IntellijIDEA. I discussed my strenuous affair with GitHub in a previous post (check here), but doing this W.O.D. was basically my first attempt at using IntelliJIDEA (besides an initial HelloWorld testing program). My thoughts on IntelliJ? Well, as an Eclipse veteran who has less religiously dabbled in several other IDEs in the past, I thought it was pleasant to look at, and relatively easy to use. I learned some keyboard shortcuts to help my coding speed within IntelliJ, and it easily synced with my GitHub account. All in all, so far, I am an IntelliJ fan.

Now, in terms of the actual W.O.D., I went in with a big head. I read the prompt, and I thought to myself, This is a really simple program. And I know how to use GitHub. I can do this under 8 minutes, easily. If not, I am a goon. However, I was less than a minute into the W.O.D., when I hit my first problem. After creating a new repository on GitHub, it would not clone to my computer. I tried cloning using File > Clone Repository on my GitHub GUI, but as soon as it tried to clone my repo, it would throw a frustratingly generic “GitHub Error.” window message. With no details, I decided that maybe my account was not set up with my computer correctly. So I delved into the GitHub settings, got myself a new key, and tried again. It still did not work. This is when I started frantically looking around the Internet, and I realized that on my GitHub page, there is a button that I can press to “Clone in Desktop.” Yes! Perhaps this would solve my problem.

I didn’t. Fascinating story short, I researched and poked around my GitHub for well over 15 minutes (past the DNF a.k.a. unacceptable time), until I decided to try to clone via the command line, because this always worked for me in the past. It didn’t work, but it did throw me a much more descriptive error, which I used to locate the problem, which existed deep in my git .config files. It was a typo of the word “input” that incorrectly read “inpit.” How this happened, I am not sure (any ideas?), but the good news is that I fixed the problem, and was ready for W.O.D. attempt number two.

### W.O.D. #2

I finished it in 6 minutes. With my self esteem back, I moved on to a second W.O.D. The problem seemed easy enough, and I recalled doing a similar problem back when I was learning recursion in my introductory Java class. I had a good start–my GitHub and IntelliJ were doing as I pleased. However, I ended up getting stuck on the actual coding. I attempted a solution that required a recursive helper method, and some how it ended up getting pretty messy (I took over 15 minutes). I needed some assistance from the Internet. When I realized how overly complicated I was making it, I attempted this W.O.D. again, and completed it in 8 minutes, which meets the top time requirements.

### W.O.D. #3

Lastly, I tried yet another W.O.D., hoping to finally conquer it flawlessly in an acceptable amount of time on the first attempt. Once again, I was a disappointment to myself. While I had now conquered the software, I was stuck on the logic of the program. Whenever my solution became far too long and complicated, I would begin to second guess myself. I went over the 15 minute mark yet again. Desperate to meet an assignment deadline, I threw in the white flag and I used the Internet to find a solution. Even when I did find solutions, I found that I did not agree with the logic. Perhaps I am just thinking about it wrong. Perhaps my brain is just fried from all these W.O.D.s. But all I know is that, although I did not finish these W.O.D.s looking victorious, I did gain useful skills in using git, GitHub, IntelliJIDEA, Java, and general problem solving.
