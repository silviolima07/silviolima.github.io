According to Eric Raymond, there are several rules that people should follow when posting technical questions on the Internet, in order to avoid becoming deemed a “luser” and receiving inadequate feedback. In order to better understand Raymond’s claims, I have scoured the internationally popular tech forum, StackOverflow, for questions that are the best of the best, as well as the worst of the worst.

### Best of the Best

This question is entitled “How can I pass the string “Null” through WSDL (SOAP) from ActionScript 3 to a ColdFusion web service without receiving a “missing parameter error”?” Although this subject header is a little lengthy, it provides all the information that another user needs and nothing more. It is not in the format that Raymond suggested, but it still contains the main parts: the objects affected, and what they are affected with. It is specific rather than vague, but pertains to a large enough audience to make it relevant enough to spend time answering. The body of the question is written in good English with proper grammar, whilst keeping the tone light and not too off-puttingly formal. It contains a very short and specific snippet of code, which illustrates the source of the problem, and the poster lists all the relevant software that is involved. The post adds some extra information which suggests that there had been research and testing done prior to asking the question. All of these aspects suggest that this post was written by an intelligent person with an honest question. The majority of the responses to this question are equally elegant and well thought out, and the question got 2518 upvotes. This shows that there were a lot of users who found this question to be useful or interesting, which makes it an excellent question.

### Worst of the Worst

This question is entitled “So explain this line to me.” This is already a terrible place to start. According to Raymond, the subject header should be “meaningful and specific,” with a short and concise description of the problem, which will catch the reader’s attention. If anything, this question’s header will drive reader attentions away, because of how vague and predictably unintelligent it sounds. Further inspection of the question reveals an equally vague body paragraph, which does not mention any prior attempts to independently solve the problem (ex. using a book, Google, trial and error, etc.). It also contains some minor, yet annoyingly apparent grammar flaws, such as the lack of punctuation and capitalization. Although this forum is not focused on proper English, such flaws can give off an impression of ignorance and carelessness, which is not a good combination. Finally, the question itself is a basic one, which can be easily answered by reading a basic programming book or doing a quick Google search. Many responses express irritation and exasperation by commanding the poster to do basic research and avoid wasting other peoples’ time. The question was also downvoted to a score of -22. I think it is safe to say that this question succeeds…at being a prime example of what NOT to do.

Unfortunately, this experience has taught me that it is a lot easier to find the not-so-intelligent questions than the intelligent questions. StackOverflow was overflowing with questions that did not meet Raymond’s guidelines, and the ones that did were the few hidden jewels along the way. Now that I am aware of how to write good questions, humanity is one step closer to getting rid of online technical forum “lusers,” and I think that is a beautiful thing.
