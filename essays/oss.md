Open-Source software (OSS) licenses are the late twentieth-century cornerstone of technological progression. Without them, programmers around the world would not be able to collaborate so easily. Code would be mostly proprietary and many projects would go unfinished. With OSS licenses, code can be shared freely (well, somewhat freely) among programmers, allowing humankind to collaborate together to create the best products that can possibly be made. The variety of OSS licenses allow owners to decide what level of freedom they would like to distribute their code with, in terms of use, distribution, and derivations.

I have not given OSS licenses much thought thus far, because I don’t believe I have created projects that are unique enough to be worth the hassle. However, if I were to choose one in the future, I would consider the GNU GPL license. My foreseeable priorities would be allowing others to create and share improvements. I would not want somebody to make improvements on my code, but then not allow others to take their improved code and do the same. I would like to create the best products possible–so this would require constant improvements and the sharing of those improvements. In a way, GPL “negates copyright” by implementing a copyleft, which allows unbounded use of code, and unbounded distribution and derivation of code, as long as the code remains under the GPL license and is left available to the public. I believe that this is a good way to keep code available for everybody, without the risk of it being taken for selfish proprietary use.
